              "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right                                                                                         as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence                which set in right from the word GO. Trust me                                                                                                                                                                                                                   this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs                                                                                                                                                              sex or violence. Its is hardcore                                                                                            in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City                                                                                    an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards                                                 so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans  Muslims     gangstas           Latinos         Christians                         Italians                                                                                                           Irish and more....so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  I couldn't say I was ready for it  but as I watched more  I developed a taste for Oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence  but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz   you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\"   \n",

              "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right                                                                                         as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence                which set in right from the word GO. Trust me                                                                                                                                                                                                                   this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs                                                                                                                                                              sex or violence.

It focuses mainly on Emerald City                                                                                    an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards                                                 so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans  Muslims     gangstas           Latinos         Christians                         Italians                                                                                                           Irish and more....so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  I couldn't say I was ready for it  but as I watched more  I developed a taste for Oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence  but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz  positive  \n",

              "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right                                                                                         as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence                which set in right from the word GO. Trust me                                                                                                                                                                                                                   this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs                                                                                                                                                              sex or violence. Its is hardcore                                                                                            in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City                                                                                    an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards                                                 so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans  Muslims     gangstas           Latinos         Christians                         Italians                                                                                                           Irish and more....so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  I couldn't say I was ready for it  but as I watched more  I developed a taste for Oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence  but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz   you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\"   \n",

              "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right                                                                                         as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence                which set in right from the word GO. Trust me                                                                                                                                                                                                                   this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs                                                                                                                                                              sex or violence.

It focuses mainly on Emerald City                                                                                    an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards                                                 so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans  Muslims     gangstas           Latinos         Christians                         Italians                                                                                                           Irish and more....so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  I couldn't say I was ready for it  but as I watched more  I developed a taste for Oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence  but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz  positive  \n",

              "\"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right                       as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word GO. Trust me                                                                                                                                                                                                                   this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs                                                                                                                                                             sex or violence. Its is hardcore                                                                                                                                        in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City                                                                         an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards  so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans                                                               Muslims  gangstas                                                                                                                                             Latinos                                                               Christians                Italians                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Irish and more....so scuffles                                                                                                                                                                                                 death stares                                          dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm                                                                                                                                                                forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  I couldn't say I was ready for it                                                                                     but as I watched more  I developed a taste for Oz                                                                                                                                                                              and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence                                                                                                                                                                                    but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel                                                   inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it   well mannered                                                                                    middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz   you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.\"   \n",
              "\"A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-BBC fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting                                                                                                                       sense of realism to the entire piece. <br /><br />The actors are extremely well chosen- Michael Sheen not only \"\"has got all the polari\"\" but he has all the voices down pat too!

This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work                                                                             pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.<br /><br />I've read numerous complaints about this film                                                         anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. \"\"The Cell\"\" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally  I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem                                             and would love to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer  and yes  I do agree that the \"\"genre\"\" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked  but most failed. But \"\"The Cell\"\" does not blaze down the same trail  we are given a new twist  we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.<br /><br />I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to e...  she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. \"\"The Cell\"\" wants to let you \"\"see\"\" what it's all about and not \"\"how\"\" it's all about  and I guess that's what some people don't like. True  I do like explanations with my movies                                                                                                                                                                                                but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.<br /><br />I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality  maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless                          the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography  best costumes          best director and the like. If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.<br /><br />I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself. Not because there's nothing else to say  but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought \"\"The Cell\"\" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a...  writing it off as \"\"weird\"\" or \"\"crazy\"\". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind  so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater  I heard one audience member say \"\"Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs.\"\" If so  I want what he was smoking.<br /><br />**** (out of 4)\"                                                                                                                                                                                    positive   \n",

This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work                                                                             pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.<br /><br />I've read numerous complaints about this film                                                         anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. \"\"The Cell\"\" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally  I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem                                             and would love to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer  and yes  I do agree that the \"\"genre\"\" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked  but most failed. But \"\"The Cell\"\" does not blaze down the same trail  we are given a new twist  we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.<br /><br />I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to e...  she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. \"\"The Cell\"\" wants to let you \"\"see\"\" what it's all about and not \"\"how\"\" it's all about  and I guess that's what some people don't like. True  I do like explanations with my movies                                                                                                                                                                                                but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.<br /><br />I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality  maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless                          the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography  best costumes          best director and the like. If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.<br /><br />I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself. Not because there's nothing else to say  but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought \"\"The Cell\"\" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a...  writing it off as \"\"weird\"\" or \"\"crazy\"\". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind  so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater  I heard one audience member say \"\"Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs.\"\" If so  I want what he was smoking.<br /><br />**** (out of 4)\"                                                                          NaN  "
